# Who is Ivan?

Hello! My name is Ivan Ribeiro Mello and I am an accountant who graduated by the University of Brasilia (UnB) and has always been a heavy user of Excel during my professional experiences in Financial Services, Audit, Banks and Fintech industries.

In my free time I love to explore new programming languages, listen to music and attend to cultural events. Probably he never left a good chilling time with cold beer and friends to the next day.

## Why is this project cool?

As I already said before I really **LOVE** music and programming languages. So I decided to wrote a Python code to extract all lyrics written by the artists I really enjoy listen to from [Vagalume.com.br](https://www.vagalume.com.br/) just to see how fun is to perform some bibliometric analysis onto this data.

## How did you achieved this project goal?

I've done some deep dive in the web looking for some Python libraries to execute web scraping. After some research I've found that [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) combined with some very well known libraries like [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) and [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) could done the trick for me!

For further details see comments I've made directly in the code! Hope you all enjoy it!
