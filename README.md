# Who is Ivan?

Hello! My name is Ivan Ribeiro Mello and I am an accountant who graduated by the University of Brasilia (UnB) and I've been learning some 'hackery tricks' ('gambiarras' in portuguese) during my professional experiences in Financial Services, Audit, Banks and Fintech industries.

In my free time I love to explore new programming languages, listen to music and attend to cultural events. Probably he never left a good chilling time with cold beer and friends to the next day.
